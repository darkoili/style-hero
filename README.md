# Project
This repository was for the class Final Project in Sprint 7.In Sprint 6 of the class I finalized this project in the form of a project proposal. The project proposal outlined that "My website would basically offer a quiz in where you are asked to pick between certain fashion style choices and then based on your answers you will have a complete outfit generated to meet your needs. The user will be prompted to answer whether or not they love or hate a certain outfit that is displayed in picture format and then their generated outfit will be displayed also as a picture." This has certainly been achieved in my final project. The proposal also ensured, "Basic techincal features will include the use of consistent coding standards and the use of javascript functions to run a quiz and offer an output from the quiz. Other features will include the heavy use of CSS to make a nice looking interface." This has also followed through to the final project.
